# ------------                                                 #
# - This model is based on the assumption that normal to the   #
#   streamwise direction, the shape of a turbine's wake        # 
#   behaves similar to the diffusion of a passive scalar.      #
#                                                              #
# - The model naturally evolves from a radially uniform        #
#   shape in the near wake to a Gaussian shape in the far      #
#   wake.                                                      # 
#                                                              #
# - The wake length scale ($\sigma$) is adjusted to take into  #
#   account the near-wake region.                              #
#                                                              #
# - The model presents analytical solutions to integrals of    #
#   the modified Bessel function within the context of         #
#   enforcing the conservation of linear momentum.             #
